# Vision Document

#### Document context:
The vision document shall fulfill its purpose through a description of:

    * Overall problem description

    * Overall description of the product that will do something about the problem

    * An analysis of the stakeholders, their needs and their responsibilities in relation to ensuring the product meets the needs
    * The environment in which the product is to operate

    * An overview of assumptions and frameworks, which if they change will change something described in this document

All vision documents have this content, but it will vary how much we write about each point and what we emphasize, and not least how we organize the content into sections and chapters.
