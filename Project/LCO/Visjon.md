# Vision Document

#### Document context:

The vision document shall fulfill its purpose through a description of:

* Overall problem description

        Since the closedown of the society because of the corona pandemic there exists a problem for musicians.
        When they are trying to practice alone the motivation slowly fades as playing alone instead of with your music group is much less rewarding.
        This may result in people losing the motivation to play and may even consider quitting.
        It is here we come with an proposition. To make a functioning web-app that lets the musicians play along to a comp with displaying notes. 
        This will function as a kind of karaoke for instumentalists and we hope it will produce som long lost motivation to keep up good practicing routines.

* Overall description of the product that will do something about the problem

        Since its not possible for musicians to gather in these times, we thought about getting them to practice anyways, just as if they are gathered. 
        So te product will be a web-app where you log in as a user. When you're logged in you will have access to a library of songs. When you choose 
        a song to play you will be able to get the sound of the comp and play along or the sound and display of notes.

* An analysis of the stakeholders, their needs and their responsibilities in relation to ensuring the product meets the
  needs

       This product will make the stakeholders able to share their comp notes among each other, and practice playing together, without having to be
       in the same place, wich will make them able to continue practicing under those circumstances.

* The environment in which the product is to operate We will be using Java, Java Script and JPA/JSP, the development

        environment will be IntelliJ. The final product will be a web-app, that will have a log in system, and further more
        options for playing.

* An overview of assumptions and frameworks, which if they change will change something described in this document

      //  Usikker?  Snakker vi om ting som kunne forandres underveis???
