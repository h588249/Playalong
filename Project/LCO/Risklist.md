##Risklist

###Communication
* The whole group will likely never sit together in a room to discuss due to restrictions around covid-19.
    * Because of this communication will primarily be run over applications like Discord, Zoom, etc.
    * This can cause multiple problems, for instance:
        * Some members of the groups disconnecting due to network problems.
        * Varying quality in microphones can cause some sentences to cut off and therefore some members not being able to get a message through in a meeting.
        * It is easier to talk over someone, when using these applications for communication, which can cause frustration.
    * Another problem could be to gather everyone for meetings when some members have part-time jobs or in general a different schedule.
    * Misunderstandings within the group or between the group and customers may lead to the product not fulfilling expectations.
        * This could also lead to the customer not approving the product, or not approving delays/ETA on finished product.

###Time
* Not being able to finish a milestone or the project in general due to:
    * Underestimating the scope of the milestone/project.
    * Not having the time needed for the milestone/project due to part-time jobs or assignments in other courses.
    * Postponing work until it is too late.
    * A member not communicating with other members when they realize that they do not have the time needed for completing a milestone. (Hand in hand with communication)

###Technology
* Work can get lost if a computer unexpectedly shuts down or malfunctions in some way.
* Some members are not as comfortable in using Git and/or IntelliJ (Primarily used eclipse for programming before the project) which can lead to various problems.

###Scope
* Not setting concrete goals could lead to some parts being less finished, or sub-par to what is expected by the rest of the group or the customer.
* Some members trying to add features that is outside set goals could lead to not finishing the goal that has been set due to time restrictions.
* Unplanned work appearing could lead to the scope being larger than expected, and could therefore lead to the scope being too big.
